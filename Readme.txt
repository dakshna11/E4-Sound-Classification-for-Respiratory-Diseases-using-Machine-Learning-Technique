Sound Classification for Respiratory Diseases using Machine Learning Techniques

Description:
  The prediction of various respiratory diseases is done using the patient's breathing sound
  which is observed using several medical equipments. The audio file has wheezes and crackles
  With the help of machine learning algorithm the data are trained and the process it executed 
  as a sample webpage.
  
Software Requirements:
   Anaconda
   Jupyter Notebook
Packages to install:
   > flask
   > werkzeug
   > pandas
   > scikit-learn(sklearn)
Steps to run the project:
 > Download the github file.
 > Open the Anaconda Prompt in your machine.
 > Navigate to the directory where the respiratory_disease_prediction.py is located.
 > Run the following command 'python respiratory_disease_prediction.py'. 
 > The following command will be displayed ' * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)'.
 > Copy the localhost url and paste it in web browser.
 > Click register and give following details.
 > Now login with registered details. 
 > The user has to give some details such as age,gender,BMI,crackles,wheezes in one option.
 > In another option the user can upload the audio file instead of crackles and wheezes.
 > The output will be displayed as disease name. If the patient has no disease it will be displayed as healthy.
